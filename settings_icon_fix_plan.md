# Plan to Fix Settings Icon Functionality

## Problem:
The settings icon in the header is not functioning because the `SettingsPanel` component in `components/task-dashboard.tsx` is currently rendered only if a `user` object exists (i.e., the user is authenticated). If the user is a guest, the settings panel will not open, even though the `onSettingsChange` prop in the `Header` correctly attempts to set `showSettings` to `true`.

## Proposed Plan:

1.  **Update `components/task-dashboard.tsx`:**
    *   Remove the `user` condition from the `SettingsPanel` rendering logic. This will allow the `SettingsPanel` to be displayed for both authenticated and guest users.
    *   Pass the `guestUser` object to the `SettingsPanel` as a prop, similar to how `user` is passed. This will provide the `SettingsPanel` with necessary context for guest users.

2.  **Update `components/settings/settings-panel.tsx`:**
    *   Modify the `SettingsPanelProps` interface to accept `guestUser: GuestUser | null`.
    *   Adjust any internal logic within `SettingsPanel` that currently relies solely on the `user` object to also consider the `guestUser` object when appropriate. This ensures that settings relevant to guest users (e.g., API key setup) can still be managed.
